# Ballistics Project Requirements

## Overview
The Ballistics Project is a comprehensive tool for calculating and visualizing bullet trajectories and related ballistic data. It aims to provide accurate predictions for shooting scenarios, taking into account various factors that affect bullet flight.

## Core Functionality Requirements

### Ballistic Calculations
- Calculate bullet trajectories in both 2D and 3D space
- Account for drag forces using ballistic coefficients
- Calculate bullet velocity at different distances
- Calculate bullet drop (point of impact) at different distances
- Calculate time of flight to reach different distances
- Convert between different units (metric, imperial) for ballistic coefficients
- Calculate maximum point blank range (MPBR) for a given target size

### Environmental Factors
- Account for air density based on temperature, pressure, and humidity
- Calculate Coriolis effect based on latitude
- Calculate spin drift based on bullet characteristics and barrel twist rate
- Calculate wind drift based on wind speed and angle

### Moving Targets
- Calculate hold (lead) for moving targets
- Generate hold tables for various target speeds and distances

### Visualization
- Plot bullet velocity over distance
- Plot bullet drop over distance
- Plot time to distance
- Plot windage effects (Coriolis, spin drift, wind drift)
- Create 3D animations of bullet trajectories
- Support saving animations as MP4 and GIF files

### Data Management
- Store and retrieve ballistic parameters
- Generate ballistic tables in various formats (DataFrame, PDF)

## Technical Requirements
